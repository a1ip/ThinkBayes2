    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we derived Bayes's Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A) P(B|A)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a dataset from the General Social Survey, we used Bayes's Theorem to compute conditional probabilities, but we didn't really need it.  \n",
    "If you have a complete dataset, it is easy enough to compute the left side of the equation directly, and no easier to compute the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when we don't have a complete dataset, Bayes's Theorem can be extremely useful.  As a simple example, we'll start with The Cookie Problem, which is based on [an example from Wikipedia that is no longer there](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose there are two bowls of cookies. \n",
    "> Bowl 1 contains 30 vanilla cookies and 10 chocolate cookies. \n",
    "> Bowl 2 contains 20 of each.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Now suppose you choose one of the bowls at random and, without\n",
    "> looking, select a cookie at random. The cookie is vanilla. What is the\n",
    "> probability that it came from Bowl 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is a conditional probability, the probability of Bowl 1 given a vanilla cookie, which I'll write $P(B_1 | V)$.  But it is not obvious how to compute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were asked a different question---the probability of a vanilla cookie given Bowl\n",
    "1---it would be easy because it's given in the statement of the problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(V | B_1) = 3/4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have $P(V | B_1)$ and we want $P(B_1 | V)$.\n",
    "They are not the same, in general, but we can use Bayes's Theorem to get from one to the other, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(B_1|V) = \\frac{P(B_1)~P(V|B_1)}{P(V)})$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The term on the left is the probability of Bowl 1, given that we chose a vanilla\n",
    "cookie. The terms on the right are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $P(B_1)$: This is the probability that we chose Bowl 1,\n",
    "    unconditioned by what kind of cookie we got. Since the problem says\n",
    "    we chose a bowl at random, we can assume $P(B_1) = 1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $P(V|B_1)$: This is the probability of getting a vanilla cookie\n",
    "    from Bowl 1, which is 3/4.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $P(V)$: This is the probability of drawing a vanilla cookie from\n",
    "    either bowl. Since we had an equal chance of choosing either bowl\n",
    "    and the bowls contain the same number of cookies, we had the same\n",
    "    chance of choosing any cookie. Between the two bowls there are 50\n",
    "    vanilla and 30 chocolate cookies, so $P(V) = 5/8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it together, we have $P(B_1|V) = \\frac{(1/2)~(3/4)}{5/8}$\n",
    "which reduces to 3/5.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates one use of Bayes's theorem: it provides a\n",
    "strategy to get from $P(B|A)$ to $P(A|B)$. \n",
    "This strategy is useful in cases like this where it is easier to compute the terms on the right side of Bayes's theorem than the term on the left."

    "## Diachronic Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another way to think of Bayes's theorem: it gives us a way to\n",
    "update the probability of a hypothesis, $H$, in light of some body of\n",
    "data, $D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of thinking about Bayes's theorem is called the **diachronic\n",
    "interpretation**. \"Diachronic\" means \"related to change over\n",
    "time\"; in this case, the probability of the hypotheses changes\n",
    "as we see new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rewriting Bayes's theorem with $H$ and $D$ yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(H|D) = \\frac{P(H)~P(D|H)}{P(D)}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In this interpretation, each term has a name:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  $P(H)$ is the probability of the hypothesis before we see the data, called\n",
    "    the prior probability, or just **prior**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  $P(H|D)$ is what we want to compute, the probability of the hypothesis after\n",
    "    we see the data, called the **posterior**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  $P(D|H)$ is the probability of the data under the hypothesis, called the\n",
    "    **likelihood**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  $P(D)$ is the **total probability of the data**, under any hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we can compute the prior based on background information. For\n",
    "example, the cookie problem specifies that we choose a bowl at random\n",
    "with equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases the prior is subjective; that is, reasonable people might\n",
    "disagree, either because they use different background information or\n",
    "because they interpret the same information differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood is usually the easiest part to compute. In the cookie\n",
    "problem, if we know which bowl the cookie came from, we find the\n",
    "probability of a vanilla cookie by counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the total probability of the data can be tricky. It is\n",
    "supposed to be the probability of seeing the data under any hypothesis\n",
    "at all, but it can be hard to nail down what that means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often we simplify things by specifying a set of hypotheses that\n",
    "are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mutually exclusive: If one hypothesis is true, the others must be false, and\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collectively exhaustive: There are no other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these conditions imply that exactly one of the hypotheses in the set must be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cookie problem, there are only two hypotheses---the cookie came\n",
    "from Bowl 1 or Bowl 2---and they are mutually exclusive and collectively\n",
    "exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case we can compute $P(D)$ using the law of total probability, which\n",
    "says that if there are two exclusive ways that something might happen,\n",
    "you can add up the probabilities like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(D) = P(B_1)~P(D|B_1) + P(B_2)~P(D|B_2)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in the values from the cookie problem, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(D) = (1/2)~(3/4) + (1/2)~(1/2) = 5/8$ \n",
    "\n",
    "which is what we computed earlier by mentally combining the two bowls."

    "Next we'll use a Bayes table to solve one of the most contentious problems in probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall problem is based on a game show called *Let's Make a Deal*.\n",
    "If you are a contestant on the show, here's how the game works:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The host, Monty Hall, shows you three closed doors numbered 1, 2, and 3. He tells\n",
    "    you that there is a prize behind each door.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   One prize is valuable (traditionally a car), the other two are less\n",
    "    valuable (traditionally goats).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The object of the game is to guess which door has the car. If you\n",
    "    guess right, you get to keep the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you pick Door 1. Before opening the door you chose, Monty opens\n",
    "Door 3 and reveals a goat. Then Monty offers you the option to stick\n",
    "with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize your chance of winning the car, should you stick with Door 1\n",
    "or switch to Door 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we have to make some assumptions about the behavior of the host:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Monty always opens a door and offers you the option to switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  He never opens the door you picked or the door with the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  If you choose the door with the car, he chooses one of the other\n",
    "    doors at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumptions, you are better off switching. \n",
    "If you stick, you win $1/3$ of the time. If you switch, you win $2/3$ of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not encountered this problem before, you might find the\n",
    "answer surprising. You would not be alone; many people have the strong\n",
    "intuition that it doesn't matter if you stick or switch. There are two\n",
    "doors left, they reason, so the chance that the car is behind Door A is\n",
    "50%. But that is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why, it can help to use a Bayes table. We start with three\n",
    "hypotheses: the car might be behind Door 1, 2, or 3. According to the\n",
    "statement of the problem, the prior probability for each door is 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is that Monty opened Door 3 and revealed a goat. So let's\n",
    "consider the probability of the data under each hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If the car is behind Door 3, Monty does not open it, so\n",
    "    the probability of the data under this hypothesis is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If the car is behind Door 2, Monty has to open Door 3, so\n",
    "    the probability of the data under this hypothesis is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If the car is behind Door 1, Monty choose Door 2 or 3 at\n",
    "    random; the probability he would open Door 3 is $1/2$.\n",

    "In this chapter we solved the Cookie Problem using Bayes's theorem explicitly and using a Bayes table.\n",
    "There's no real difference between these methods, but the Bayes table can make it easier to compute the total probability of the data, especially for problems with more than two hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we solved the Dice Problem, which we will come back to in Chapter 4, and the Monty Hall problem, which you might hope you never see again.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Monty Hall problem makes your head hurt, you are not alone.  But I think it demonstrates the power of Bayes's Theorem as a divide-and-conquer strategy for solving tricky problems.  And I hope it provides some insight into *why* the answer is what it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Monty opens a door, he provides information we can use to update our belief about the location of the car.  Part of the information is obvious.  If he opens Door 3, we know the car is not behind Door 3.  But part of the information is more subtle.  Opening Door 3 is more likely if the car is behind Door 2, and less likely if it is behind Door 1.  So the data is evidence in favor of Door 2.  We will come back to this notion of evidence in future chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter we'll extend the Cookie Problem and the Dice Problem, and take the next step from basic probability to Bayesian statistics."
